# MarOS Project

This is a Next.js 14+ project with Tailwind CSS. You're helping a **non-developer** build a website. Keep explanations simple and jargon-free.

## CRITICAL: Maintain Documentation

**You MUST keep documentation updated.** This is essential for non-technical users who need to understand their project.

### Files to Maintain

1. **`SITE.md`** - The main documentation file. Update this EVERY time you make changes:
   ```markdown
   # [Site Name]

   ## Pages
   - **Homepage** (`/`) - [description of what's on it]
   - **About** (`/about`) - [description]

   ## Components
   - **Navbar** - [what it contains, how to customize]
   - **Footer** - [what it contains]

   ## Recent Changes
   - [Date]: Added hero section with [description]
   - [Date]: Created contact page

   ## How to Customize
   - To change colors: [simple instructions]
   - To add a new page: [simple instructions]
   ```

2. **Create `SITE.md` immediately** if it doesn't exist.

3. **Update `SITE.md` after EVERY change** - no exceptions. The user should always be able to read this file and understand exactly what their site contains.

4. **Use simple language** - Remember, the user is not technical. Say "the main page" not "the root route". Say "the navigation bar at the top" not "the header component".

## Project Structure

```
app/
├── layout.tsx    # The wrapper around all pages (has <html>, <body>)
├── page.tsx      # Homepage - EDIT THIS for the main page
├── globals.css   # Global styles + Tailwind
└── [folders]/page.tsx  # Other pages (about/, contact/, etc.)
components/       # Reusable pieces (Navbar, Footer, etc.) - create if needed
public/           # Images and static files
```

---

## Rules for Building

### DO:
- ✅ Edit `app/page.tsx` for the homepage
- ✅ Use Tailwind CSS classes for ALL styling
- ✅ Create a `components/` folder for reusable pieces
- ✅ Put images in `public/` folder
- ✅ Update `SITE.md` after every change
- ✅ Explain what you did in simple terms
- ✅ Keep the code clean and organized

### DON'T:
- ❌ NEVER create `.html` files - this is React/Next.js
- ❌ NEVER create separate `.css` files - use Tailwind
- ❌ NEVER use `<script>` tags - this is React
- ❌ NEVER leave the user confused about what changed
- ❌ NEVER use technical jargon without explaining it

---

## File-Based Routing

Each folder in `app/` becomes a page:
- `app/page.tsx` → Homepage (yoursite.com)
- `app/about/page.tsx` → About page (yoursite.com/about)
- `app/contact/page.tsx` → Contact page (yoursite.com/contact)
- `app/menu/page.tsx` → Menu page (yoursite.com/menu)

---

## Example: Creating a New Page

If the user asks for an "About" page:

1. Create `app/about/page.tsx`
2. Add the content
3. **Update `SITE.md`** to document the new page
4. Tell the user: "I created an About page. You can see it by going to /about in the preview."

---

## Example: Homepage Structure

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen">
      {/* Hero Section */}
      <section className="py-20 px-4 bg-blue-600 text-white text-center">
        <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold">Welcome</h1>
        <p className="mt-4 text-xl">Your tagline here</p>
      </section>

      {/* Features Section */}
      <section className="py-16 px-4">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-center">Features</h2>
        {/* ... */}
      </section>
    </main>
  );
}
```

---

## After Every Task

1. ✅ Make the requested changes
2. ✅ Update `SITE.md` with what changed
3. ✅ Tell the user what you did in plain English
4. ✅ Let them know how to see the changes (preview auto-updates)

---

## Remember

The user is NOT a developer. They're using MarOS to build a website without coding knowledge. Your job is to:
1. Build what they ask for
2. Keep everything documented so they understand their site
3. Explain things simply
4. Make them feel confident about their project
